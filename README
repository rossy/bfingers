When I was a little filly and the sun was going down.
The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown.
I'd hide under my pillow from what I thought I saw.
But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way to deal with fears at all, she said:
When the pimp's in the crib ma, drop it like it's hot.
Drop it like it's hot.
Drop it like it's hot.
When the pigs try to get at ya, park it like it's hot.
Park it like it's hot.
Park it like it's hot.
And if a zebra get a attitude, pop it like it's hot.
Pop it like it's hot.
Pop it like it's hot.
I got the rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon and I roll the best weed cause I got it going on.
